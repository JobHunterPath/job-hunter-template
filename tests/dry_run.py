    Hiring Manager
    Dear Sir/Madam,
    
    I am interested in the {job['title']} position at {job['company']}.
    
    With 7 years of product management experience, I have successfully led cross-functional teams 
    in complex environments. My background spans strategy definition, roadmap development, and 
    stakeholder alignment across engineering, sales, and customer success.
    
    At ExampleCo, I led platform initiatives with engineering, design, and customer-facing teams.
    Replace this sentence with a verified metric from your own story bank.
    
    I would be pleased to discuss how my experience contributes to {job['company']}'s mission.
    
    Sincerely,
    Candidate Name
